Before today; the price of property listing in client websites on Homes in Asia, were defaulted to the clients
currency of preference. This made matters simple in the engineering side. But a major Sri Lankan real-estate
agency preferred the ability to select a currency. It was a great idea, we agreed, and that is exactly what we
introduce today. 

For example, some of your clients would be using local currency. Others would be interested in dealing in US
currency.

We understood the importance of been able to support multiple currencies. But how do we deal with the ever
changing currency conversions. Without it, a search that is able to narrow down listings by value will not be
accurate.

That is why we partnered with Open Exchange Rates. We obtain up to date currency information to provide users
with accurate search results.

I take this opportunity to thank the great people at Open Exchange Rates for teh good work they do.
