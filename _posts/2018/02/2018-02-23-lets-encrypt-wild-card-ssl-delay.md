Homes in Asia is the largest and fully featured free real-estate website builder in the world. If you would have
tried to make your own fully featured ordinary website, you know the costs involved. Homes in Asia comes to you by
the courtesy of me. As a freelance web developer I can't let the costs go higher than $1000.00 a month. That is where
free tools like Lets Encrypt comes to action.

Lets Encrypt is a free, automated, open source certificate authority sponsored by some of the largest tech companies
in the world and also many generous individuals. It helps websites encrypt traffic so that your credentials especially
things like your credit card information wouldn't be compromised easily.

But so far, Lets Encrypt hasn't supported Wild Card SSL. Its a major requirement for a service like ours providing
sub-domain based websites for our registered agents / agencies.

I have waited for nearly 3 years for this feature and the wait is coming to an end. Lets Encrypt has Wild Card SSL
in its testing. It was originally expected to be released in February 27<sup>th</sup>. But the good folks at Lets
Encrypt had to focus on a critical issue loosing 2 weeks.

We can expect the feature been available to us in March 2018.

Even if we don't understand a thing about SSL or security, lets give a shout out to the great engineers at the non
profit Lets Encrypt certificate authority. Thanks and good luck guys!
