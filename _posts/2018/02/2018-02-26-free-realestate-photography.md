You may have the best house in the town, but if you don't advertise it with high quality photos, you will get only
10% of the attention it deserves, a scientific research confirms. This is why you should get some one with good
photography gear and an eye for composition to take photos and talent to post process images.

I am not saying that guy is me. Bu I do have the gear, have an eye for composition, creative and have done real-estate
photography before. I am offering this service to expand my real-estate photography portfolio. Given my limited
availability I would limit my services to 2 properties a week (on Sundays) limited to 8 a month.

If I do agree to photograph your property, some of them would get published online in my photography portfolio. I
am afraid this is non negotiable. I also only want to deal with the property owner or a family member of the owner.

If interested, send an email to ziyan@jdeen.com with the following details:

- Name
- Phone
- Are you the owner? Otherwise what is your relation to the owner?
- Address
- Intending to rent or sale
- A couple photos taken early in the morning or evening (to determine how shadows fall)
- If possible, location on a Googel Map (you might need to ask your child ;))

You do require to understand either English or Sinhalese and be located in Colombo, Sri Lanka.
