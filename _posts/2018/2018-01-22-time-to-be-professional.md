If you are a business, people expect you to have a website. People like me would not even consider you as an option if
you don't have a website. That is why I cannot emphasize enough on the importance of a website for a real-estate agent
or a real-estate agency.

Few months back I was looking for a house for a friend of mine. I placed an advertisement. Among many real-estate
agents and agencies, very few sounded like they knew understood the requirements. I short listed 5 agents/agencies and
did some research on them online before I set off with them to look for a house.

Only 2 out of the 5 agents had a website. One of which was crap. I couldn't even get it to load properly. The usable
one was nothing special. I reached out to few CEOs in my contact list and few mentioned a guy I dropped off because
of the lack of a website. So I thought of giving both the one with a website and the one without a chance.

While both agents were good, the one who lacked a website was surprising professional, knowledgeable. The first
property that he had short listed was more or less the one I was looking for.

I asked him why he didn't have a website. It turned out that he had spent a lot of money on a website using local (Sri
Lankan). While the product had been functional at first it had got got slow and buggy in time.

So I thought it would be great area for me to get involved.

I will provide you real-estate agents with cutting edge websites for free. You be professional. Join Homes in Asia
