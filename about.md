T.E. Lawrence, eponymously of Arabia, but very much an Englishman, favored pinching a burning match between his fingers to put it out. When asked by his colleague, William Potter, to reveal his trick -- how is it he so effectively extinguished the flame without hurting himself whatsoever -- Lawrence just smiled and said, "The trick, Potter, is not minding it hurts."

The fire that danced at the end of that match was a gift from the Titan, Prometheus, a gift that he stole from the gods. When Prometheus was caught and brought to justice for his theft, the gods, well, you might say they overreacted a little. The poor man was tied to a rock as an eagle ripped through his belly and ate his liver over and over, day after day, ad infinitum. All because he gave us fire, our first true piece of technology: Fire.

- 100,000 BC: Stone tools.
- 4,000 BC: The wheel.
- 9th century AD: Gunpowder. Bit of a game-changer, that one.
- 19th century: Eureka! The light bulb!!
- 20th century: The automobile, television, nuclear weapons, space craft, Internet.
- 21st century: Biotech, nanotech, fusion and fission, and M-theory -- and that was just the first decade.

We are now 3 months  in to the year 2018. The world is rapidly moving forward, but the real-estate industry in Asia is still stuck in the previous century.

I am reimagining the asian real-estate industry.

I will provide real-estate agents fully featured free real-estate websites. In addition I will provide them with professional looking business cards, letterheads, news paper advertisement templates to transcend their business.

Owners will have the ability to freely advertise their property.

One day what I do at Homes in Asia will be the international standard in real-estate.

For those of you who know me, you will be aware by now that my ambition is unlimited. You know that I will settle for nothing short
of greatness, or I will die trying.

For those of you who do not yet know me, allow me to introduce my self: My name is Ziyan Junaideen, and if you'll indulge me, I'd
like to change the world.
